Welcome to my blog!
During recent job searches I have come to the conclusion that Ruby on Rails and React are highly requested.
I'll be outlining my journey and things I learn along the way.
I've rebuilt my website in Nextjs as it seems to be an industry leading way to write such websites in React currently.
If developers have any feedback or recruiters want to get in touch, feel free to email me.
